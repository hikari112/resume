# Welcome to Jesse Sanford's GitHub!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Jesse, a dynamic and self-taught programmer with a strong passion for learning and innovation in software development. I specialize in Pine script, Python, and C#, and I'm enthusiastic about both front-end and back-end development, as well as software engineering.

## About Me

- **Professional Path**: I've been leading the development of advanced trading algorithms and technical indicators as a Lead Pine Script Developer at Chart Prime since 2023. I also have experience in freelance programming, working on diverse projects that range from financial trading strategies to innovative audio effects.
- **Academic Journey**: While I'm largely self-taught, my journey in programming has been fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, underpinned by a strong foundation in mathematics and problem-solving.
- **Project Highlights**: Some of my notable projects include a [3D Bowling Game Engine](https://www.tradingview.com/script/GPuXpSFc-3D-Bowling/) built in Pine Script, and an [audio effect tool](https://github.com/hikari112/Aliaser) in Python that creatively manipulates sound. I'm currently working on a finance app designed to help average consumers delve into investing, utilizing Rust and React Native.

## My Interests

- **Music**: Outside of coding, I'm a passionate musician, playing the piano and guitar, and creating electronic music.
- **Continuous Learning**: I have a personal library brimming with books on mathematics and programming, reflecting my commitment to lifelong learning and skill enhancement.
- **Problem Solving**: I thrive on tackling challenging coding projects that involve intricate problem-solving and statistical analysis.
